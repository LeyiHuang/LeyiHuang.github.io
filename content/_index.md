Hi, my name is **Leyi**. I moved from Hangzhou to San Diego for college. Then I went to graduate school in Bay Area. In my spare time, I love pen sketching 🖋️ and playing with my cats Gulu and Mimi 🐱. 
You can find my art journal on instagram: @leyi_sketch
For mind-blowing cuteness, please check this: @gulu.mimi
