Hi, my name is **Leyi** and I am currently an undergraduate student studying molecular and cell biology at the **University of California, San Diego**. I have a passion for exploring the intricate machinery of the natural world and have gained practical experience working in research labs where I have focused on developing fluorescent biosensors. I am excited to continue pursuing my interests in biology and to share my journey through my blog.

In my spare time, I love reading novels and comics 📚 
btw I am also a ramen connoisseur 🍜
